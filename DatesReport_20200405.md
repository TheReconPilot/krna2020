# Report on Possible Dates

The document covers many colleges. We are yet to check on any schools and some of the colleges. 

### Important Events for IISER Pune

#### Exams

| Exam | Dates |
| ---- | ----- |
| Mid Sem Exams | 21 Sep - 26 Sep |
| End Sem Exams | 23 Nov - 28 Nov |
| KVPY | 01 Nov / 08 Nov |

#### Holidays

| Holiday | Date | Day |
| ------  | ---- | --- |
| Dussehra | 25 Oct | Sunday |
| Eid-e-Milad | 30 Oct | Friday |
| Diwali | 14 Nov | Saturday |


Most colleges don't have their 2020-21 Academic Calendar set up yet. So, much of the estimation is based on the 2019-20 Academic Year data.

The data that the last year team compiled also seems to be based on much of 2018 data.

### Suggestion

Based on the data, **the best weekend to hold Karavaan 2020 is `30 Oct - 31 Oct - 01 Nov`**, which is a **Fri - Sat - Sun** weekend.

The Advantages and Risks

- 30 Oct is a holiday for Eid-e-Milad, as mentioned above in the Holidays section. We get Friday for use.
- 01 Nov can be a possible KVPY exam date. But, we have 30 Oct extra so...

So far, we have only seen clashes for the following:
- SPPU - Savitribai Phule Pune University
- SLS - Symbiosis Law School
- SSBS - Symbiosis School of Biological Sciences

Considering the fact that other smaller colleges come under SPPU, the clash may be slightly larger than anticipated here.

However, **we take any other weekend and the number of clashes are just larger.**

The previous weekend of `24 Oct - 25 Oct`, and the next weekend of `07 Nov - 08 Nov` both show higher number of clases than the suggested weekend. 

Also, since the KVPY 2020 date is still uncertain, the `07 Nov - 08 Nov` is a greater risk too.


### Precaution

Dates are based on the 2019 data mostly, and we might need to wait till the new academic year to see the actual data for most colleges. However, the estimates should be reasonably valid, as we do not expect the exam patterns to change by more than a week.

## Targeted Institutes

Going with our general theme of Cinema, we tried to find data for institutes like FTII - Film and Television Institute of India, but turned up empty handed. 

We are also yet to collect data for a few institutes which may be more aligned to the theme.

___

## Data for Schools

Schools generally do not have any useful information on website. It is difficult to collect data from them.

Here, the Pune residents of the Karavaan Team can come to help. See the next section for details.

___

## Requests to the GCs

- You can ask the Punekars in the K-Team to ask around about what general events are going on during late October and early November.
- You can ask the people in the K-Team if they know people around in Pune colleges doing courses relating to our theme. Like, anyone studying at FTII for example. A contact over there can prove useful.
